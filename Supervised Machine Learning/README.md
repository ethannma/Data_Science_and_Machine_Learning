# Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. This means each training example includes both the input data and the correct output (label). The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so it can predict the correct label for new, unseen data. This makes it almost like learning with a teacher or an answer key. The algorithm is trained on a dataset that is labeled, meaning each piece of input data is tagged with a correct output or "answer" to help its predictions in the end. There are two main types of supervised learning:  

1. Classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam)  
2. Regression (e.g., predicting house prices)

# List of algorithms implemented
In this project, we implement the following algorithms on an NBA player dataset, with the goal of both learning more about current eye-test sentiments, as well as to investigate the overall advanced analytics movement.

• The Perceptron  
• Linear Regression  
• Logistic Regression  
• Neural Networks  
• K Nearest Neighbors  
• Decision Trees / Regression Trees  
• Random Forests  
• Other Ensemble Methods, including Boosting
