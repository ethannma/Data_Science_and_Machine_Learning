# Linear Regression

Linear Regression precedes Machine Learning. It is one of the earlist forms of supervised modeling and serves the purpose of finding relationships between a set of independent variables and a specific dependent variable.

In this project, I will be using linear regression to predict player points per game based on two specific player box score statistics (usage rate and true shooting percentage) to predict the points per game statistic.

# Data

The dataset used here tracks all basic box score and biographical stats of every NBA player from 1996 to 2022 such as height, weight, points per game, net rating, season, and many more. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data
