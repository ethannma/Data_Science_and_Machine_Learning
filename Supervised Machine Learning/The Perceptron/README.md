# The Perceptron

In Machine Learning, the Perceptron is one of the simplest, most fundamental neural networks. It was originally introduced in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt and serves as a binary classifier, learning a linear decision boundary and characterizing data based on that.

In this project, I will be building and implementing a Perceptron model, training it on NBA player data. I will use two specific player box score statistics (usage rate and true shooting percentage) to predict the points per game statistic.

# Data

The dataset used here tracks all basic box score and biographical stats of every NBA player from 1996 to 2022 such as height, weight, points per game, net rating, season, and many more. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data

# Libraries
The following python libraries are used.

matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
numpy (https://numpy.org/)
pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)
seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
scikit learn (https://scikit-learn.org/)
