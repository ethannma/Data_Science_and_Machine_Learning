# Neural Networks

Neural networks are models inspired by the brain. They consist of layers of neurons (nodes) connected with weights. They have multiple layers and work layer by layer, taking the input layer and neuron-based intermediate layers that change the data using weights and functions, as well as a final output layer containing the model's predictions.
