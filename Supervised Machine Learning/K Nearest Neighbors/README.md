# K Nearest Neighbors

KNN is a non-parametric classification or regression algorithm. For every data point, it finds the K closest training examples (using distance metrics like Euclidean). It can be applied as both classification and regression.
1. For classification, it assigns the most common label among neighbors.
2. For regression, it returns the average value.
