# Data Science and Machine Learning
This is my project repository for Rice CMOR 438 Summer 2025.

In this reposity I apply and demonstrate a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms on various datasets. The topics covered are listed below:

Supervised Learning  
• The Perceptron  
• Linear Regression  
• Logistic Regression  
• Neural Networks  
• K Nearest Neighbors  
• Decision Trees / Regression Trees  
• Random Forests  
• Other Ensemble Methods, including Boosting  
  
Unsupervised Learning  
• K-Means Clustering  
• DBSCAN  
• Principal Component Analysis  
• Image Compression with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  
  

In the supervised portion, I focused on NBA datasets, exploring various different possible relationships between stats. I did this out of curiosity for the overall debate surrounding the advanced analytics movement in the NBA. I also applied machine learning algorithms to find concrete findings that back up recent trends in the NBA that have been mostly word of mouth and from the eye test in ways that I haven't seen quantified, mainly surrounding the positionless basketball movement. In the unsupervised portion
