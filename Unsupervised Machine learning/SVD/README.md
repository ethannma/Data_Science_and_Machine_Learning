# Singular Value Decomposition

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is given by the following formula:
$$
A = U \Sigma V^T
$$

- U: An orthogonal matrix whose columns are the left-singular vectors.
- $\Sigma$: A diagonal matrix containing the singular values of A, which are always non-negative and are typically sorted in descending order. These values represent the "importance" of different components of the original matrix.
- $V^T$: An orthogonal matrix whose columns are the right-singular vectors.
