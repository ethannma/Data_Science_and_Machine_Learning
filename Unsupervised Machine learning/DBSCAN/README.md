# DBSCAN

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm. It groups together points that are close in dense regions and labels isolated points in low-density areas as noise. It uses two parameters: epsilon, or the radius around a point to look for neighbors, and minpts, or the minimum number of points needed to form a dense region.
