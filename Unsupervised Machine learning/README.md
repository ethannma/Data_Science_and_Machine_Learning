# Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on data without labeled outputs. The goal is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings within the data without the aid of labels or feedback. Essentially, it's like learning without a teacher or an answer key; the algorithm is given a dataset that is unlabeled, meaning the data only has input features but no corresponding output labels.

2. Dimensionality reduction

## List of algorithms implemented
In this project, we implement the following algorithms on an NBA player dataset, with the goal of both learning more about current eye-test sentiments, as well as to investigate the overall advanced analytics movement.

• K-Means Clustering  
• DBSCAN  
• Principal Component Analysis
