# K Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

This project explores two fundamental unsupervised learning techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K Means for clustering. Unsupervised learning is used when we do not have pre-labeled data; instead, the goal is to find interesting patterns or structures within the data itself.
